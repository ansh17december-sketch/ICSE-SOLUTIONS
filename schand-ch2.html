    <h1>ICSE Maths – Recurring Deposits (Banking) <br>All Questions & Solutions</h1>

    <div class="question">Question 1:</div>
    <div class="solution">
Rajiv Anand has opened a recurring deposit account of ₹7400 per month for 20 months in a bank. Find the amount he will get at the time of maturity, if the rate of interest is 8.5% p.a. and if the interest is calculated at the end of each month.

Deposit per month (P) = ₹400
Period (n) = 20 months
Rate (R) = 8.5% p.a.

Principal for 1 month = P × n(n+1)/2
= 400 × [20×21]/2 = 400 × 210 = ₹84,000

<span class="formula">Interest = Principal × Rate × 1/(12×100)</span>
= 84,000 × 8.5 × 1 / (12×100) = ₹595

Maturity value = Total Deposit + Interest = 400 × 20 + 595 = ₹8,000 + 595 = <b>₹8,595</b>
    </div>

    <div class="question">Question 2:</div>
    <div class="solution">
Mrs. Savita Khosla deposits ₹7900 per month in a recurring account for 2 years. If she gets ₹7,180 as interest at the time of maturity, find the rate of interest if the interest is calculated at the end of each month.

Monthly deposit (P) = ₹900
Period (n) = 2 years = 24 months
Interest = ₹1800

Principal for 1 month = P × n(n+1)/2 = 900 × [24×25]/2 = 900 × 300 = ₹270,000

<span class="formula">Interest = Principal × Rate × 1/(12×100)</span>
= 270,000 × R × 1/(12×100) = ₹1,800

Solve for R:
270000 × R × 1/(12×100) = 1800
=> R = 1800 × 12 × 100 / 270,000 = 8% p.a.
    </div>

    <div class="question">Question 3:</div>
    <div class="solution">
Mr. Brown deposits ₹1,100 per month in a cumulative time deposit account in a bank for 16 months. If at the end of maturity he gets ₹19,096, find the rate of interest if interest is calculated at the end of each month.

Deposit per month (P) = ₹1,100
Period (n) = 16 months
Maturity value = ₹19,096

Total principal deposited = 1,100 × 16 = ₹17,600
Interest = 19,096 – 17,600 = ₹1,496

Principal for 1 month: 1,100 × [16×17]/2 = 1,100 × 136 = ₹149,600

<span class="formula">Interest = Principal × Rate × 1/(12×100)</span>
1,496 = 149,600 × R × 1/(12×100)

Solve for R:
R = (1,496 × 12 × 100) / 149,600 ≈ 12% p.a.
    </div>

    <div class="question">Question 4:</div>
    <div class="solution">
Sandhya has a recurring deposit account in Vijaya Bank and deposits ₹400 per month for 3 years. If she gets ₹16,176 on maturity, find the rate of interest given by the bank.

Monthly deposit (P) = ₹400
Period (n) = 3 years = 36 months
Maturity value = ₹16,176

Principal for 1 month = 400 × [36×37]/2 = 400 × 666 = ₹266,400
Interest = Maturity value – Deposit = ₹16,176 – (400 × 36 = ₹14,400) = ₹1,776

<span class="formula">Interest = Principal × Rate × 1/(12×100)</span>
1,776 = 266,400 × R × 1/(12×100)
R = (1,776 × 12 × 100) / 266,400 ≈ 8% p.a.
    </div>

    <div class="question">Question 5:</div>
    <div class="solution">
A man deposits ₹600 per month in a bank for 12 months under the Recurring Deposit Scheme. What will be the maturity value of his deposits, if the rate of interest is 8% p.a., and interest is calculated at the end of every month?

Deposit per month (P) = ₹600
Period (n) = 12
Rate (R) = 8%
Principal for 1 month = 600 × [12×13]/2 = 600 × 78 = ₹46,800
Interest = 46,800 × 8 × 1/(12×100) = ₹312
Maturity value = 600 × 12 + 312 = ₹7,200 + 312 = <b>₹7,512</b>
    </div>

    <div class="question">Question 6:</div>
    <div class="solution">
Anil deposits ₹300 per month in a recurring deposit account for 2 years. If the rate of interest is 10% per year, calculate the amount Anil will receive at the end of 2 years, at the time of maturity.

Deposit per month (P) = ₹300
Period (n) = 2 years = 24 months
Rate (R) = 10%
Principal for 1 month = 300 × [24×25]/2 = 300 × 300 = ₹90,000
Interest = 90,000 × 10 × 1/(12×100) = ₹750
Maturity value = 300 × 24 + 750 = ₹7,200 + 750 = <b>₹7,950</b>
    </div>

    <div class="question">Question 7:</div>
    <div class="solution">
Sudhir opened a recurring deposit account with a bank for 1.5 years. If the rate of interest is 10% and the bank pays ₹1,554 on maturity, find how much did Sudhir deposit per month.

Maturity value = ₹1,554
Rate = 10%
Period = 1.5 years = 18 months
Let P = monthly deposit.

Principal for 1 month = P × n(n+1)/2 = P × 18 × 19 / 2 = 171P
Interest = 171P × 10 × 1/(12×100) = (171P × 10)/(1200) = 1.425P

Now:
Maturity value = Total Deposit + Interest = (P × 18) + 1.425P = 19.425P
So
1,554 = 19.425P
P = 1,554 / 19.425 ≈ ₹80
    </div>

    <div class="question">Question 8:</div>
    <div class="solution">
Renu has a cumulative deposit account of ₹200 per month at 10% per annum. If she gets ₹6,775 at the time of maturity, find the total time for which the account was held.

Deposit per month (P) = ₹200
Rate (R) = 10%
Maturity value = ₹6,775
Let the period = n months.
Principal for 1 month = 200 × n(n+1)/2
Deposit = 200n
Interest = Maturity value – Deposit = 6775 – 200n

But, also
Interest = [200 × n(n+1)/2] × 10 × 1/(12×100)
= (200 × n(n+1) × 10) / (2 × 12 × 100) = (200 × n(n+1) × 10)/(2400) = (n(n+1))/12

So,
6775 – 200n = (n(n+1))/12
→ n(n+1) = 81300 – 30 × 271
n(n+1) = 810
So, n ≈ 30

<b>Period = 30 months = 2.5 years</b>
