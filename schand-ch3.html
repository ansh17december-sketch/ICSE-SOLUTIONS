    <h1>S.Chand ICSE Class 10 Mathematics<br>Exercise 3(a): Shares and Dividends</h1>

    <div class="question">Question 1:</div>
    <div class="solution">
      <b>(a)</b> Face value of each share = Rs. 25<br>
      Market value of each share = Rs. 60 + 25 = Rs. 85<br>
      Cost of 1000 shares = Rs. 85 × 1000 = <b>Rs. 85,000</b><br><br>
      
      <b>(b)</b> Face value of each share = Rs. 100<br>
      Market value of each share = Rs. 30.80<br>
      Value of 450 shares = Rs. 30.80 × 450 = <b>Rs. 13,860</b>
    </div>

    <div class="question">Question 2:</div>
    <div class="solution">
      Krisha Ltd declared dividend on<br>
      (i) 450 shares with par value of Rs. 10 if the annual dividend is 4.5%<br>
      <span class="formula">Dividend = Number of shares × Face value × Rate%</span><br>
      = 450 × Rs. 10 × 4.5% = <b>Rs. 202.50</b><br><br>
      
      (ii) 108 Shri Ram Fibres 7½% (Rs. 10) shares at 14.50<br>
      = 108 × Rs. 10 × 7.5% = <b>Rs. 81</b><br><br>
      
      (iii) 100 Hindustan Motors (Rs. 10) shares at Rs. 8 dividend 4% p.a.<br>
      = 100 × Rs. 10 × 4% = <b>Rs. 40</b>
    </div>

    <div class="question">Question 3:</div>
    <div class="solution">
      (a) Face value of each share = Rs. 10<br>
      Value of 450 shares = Rs. 10 × 450 = Rs. 4500<br>
      Total dividend = 7.5% of Rs. 4500 = <b>Rs. 337.50</b><br><br>
      
      (b) Face value of each share = Rs. 4<br>
      Value of 50 shares = Rs. 4 × 50 = Rs. 200<br>
      Total dividend = 4% of Rs. 200 = <b>Rs. 8</b><br><br>
      
      (c) Face value of each share = Rs. 10<br>
      Value of 180 shares = Rs. 10 × 180 = Rs. 1800<br>
      Rate of dividend = 7½% = 7.5%<br>
      Total dividend = 7.5% of Rs. 1800 = <b>Rs. 135</b>
    </div>

    <div class="question">Question 4:</div>
    <div class="solution">
      Write down the sum of money obtained by selling 60 (Rs. 100) shares at 112.<br><br>
      
      By selling one share, money is obtained = Rs. 112<br>
      By selling 60 shares, money will be = 60 × 112 × 90 = <b>Rs. 6,720</b>
    </div>

    <div class="question">Question 5:</div>
    <div class="solution">
      David invests Rs. 6250 in shares of a company paying 6% per annum. If he bought Rs. 25 shares for Rs. 31.25 each, find his annual income from this investment.<br><br>
      
      By investing Rs. 31.25, shares can be purchased = 1<br>
      By investing Rs. 6250, number of shares can be purchased = 6250 ÷ 31.25 = 200<br>
      
      Nominal value of 200 shares at the rate of Rs. 25 per share = Rs. 25 × 200 = Rs. 5000<br>
      Rate of dividend = 6%<br>
      Total dividend = Rs. 5000 × 6/100 = <b>Rs. 300</b>
    </div>

    <div class="question">Question 6:</div>
    <div class="solution">
      Write down the price of 100 (Rs. 10) shares costing Rs. 2000.<br><br>
      
      Price of 100 shares = Rs. 2000<br>
      Face value of each share = Rs. 10<br>
      Price per share = 2000 ÷ 100 = <b>Rs. 20</b>
    </div>

    <div class="question">Question 7:</div>
    <div class="solution">
      A company declares semi-annual dividend of 5%. Krishna Lal owns 25 shares of par value Rs. 12.50 each. How much annual dividend must he receive?<br><br>
      
      Face value of each share = Rs. 12.50<br>
      Value of 25 shares = Rs. 12.50 × 25 = Rs. 312.50<br>
      Rate of dividend = 5% semi-annual<br>
      Annual dividend = 5 × 2 = 10%<br>

      Number of shares = 250<br>
      Face value of each share = Rs. 1<br>
      Total face value = Rs. 250<br>
      Face value of 250 shares = 250 × 1 = Rs. 250<br>
      Rate of dividend = (20/250) × 100 = <b>8%</b>

      Investment = Rs. 4800<br>
      Rate of dividend = 8%<br>
      Face value of each share = Rs. 100<br>
      Market value of each share = Rs. 160<br>
      Number of shares = 4800 ÷ 160 = 30<br>
      
      (i) Total face value of 30 shares = Rs. 100 × 30 = Rs. 3000<br>
      (ii) Rate of interest on his investment = (240/4800) × 100 = <b>5%</b>

      Number of shares = 1000<br>
      Nominal value of each share = Rs. 5<br>
      Market value of each share = Rs. 7<br>
      Rate of dividend = 8%<br>
      
      (i) Total face value of 1000 shares = Rs. 5 × 1000 = Rs. 5000<br>
      Amount of investment = 1000 × Rs. 7 = Rs. 7000<br>
      
      (ii) Total dividend = Rs. 5000 × 8/100 = Rs. 400<br>
      Rate of interest = Rs. (400/7000) × 100 = <b>5.7%</b><br>

      Total face value of all shares = Rs. 100 × 10000 = Rs. 1000000<br>
      
      (i) Total dividend paid by the company = Rs. 1000000 × 8/100 = <b>Rs. 80000</b><br>
      
      Number of shares Ramesh has = 90<br>
      Value of 90 shares = Rs. 100 × 90 = Rs. 9000<br>
      Dividend = Rs. 9000 × 8/100 = Rs. 720<br>
      Market value per share = Rs. 150<br>
      Investment cost = 90 shares × Rs. 150 × 90 = Rs. 13500<br>

      (ii) the number of shares she buys<br>
      (iii) the annual dividend on these shares.<br><br>
      
      Number of shares Aditi has = 40<br>
      Nominal value of each share = Rs. 100<br>
      Total value of 40 shares = Rs. 100 × 40 = Rs. 4000<br>
      Market price of each share = Rs. 100 + 50 = Rs. 150<br>
      
      (i) Amount received on selling them = Rs. 150 × 40 = <b>Rs. 6000</b><br>
      (ii) In second case, nominal value of each share = Rs. 75<br>
      Market value of each share 20% discount = Rs. 75 - 15 = Rs. 60<br>
      Number of shares purchased = 6000 ÷ 60 = <b>100</b><br>
      
      Rate of dividend = 20% annually<br>
      (iii) Number of shares = 100<br>
      (iv) Face value of 100 shares at the rate of Rs. 75 = 75 × 100 = Rs. 7500<br>

      Rate of dividend = 12%<br>
      
      (i) Total value of 1600 shares = Rs. 100 × 1600 = Rs. 160000<br>
      Total dividend = Rs. 160000 × 12/100 = <b>Rs. 19200</b><br>
      
      Cost per share = Rs. 100 + 50 = Rs. 150<br>
      Total investment = 1600 × 150 = Rs. 240000<br>
      Percentage return will be = (19200/240000) × 100 = <b>8%</b>
