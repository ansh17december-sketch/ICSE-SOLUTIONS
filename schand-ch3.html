      By investing Rs. 31.25, shares can be purchased = 1<br>
      By investing Rs. 6250, number of shares can be purchased = 6250 ÷ 31.25 = 200<br>
      
      Nominal value of 200 shares at the rate of Rs. 25 per share = Rs. 25 × 200 = Rs. 5000<br>
      Rate of dividend = 6%<br>

      Investment = Rs. 4800<br>
      Rate of dividend = 8%<br>
      Face value of each share = Rs. 100<br>
      Market value of each share = Rs. 160<br>
      Number of shares = 4800 ÷ 160 = 30<br>

      By investing Rs. 7,500 in a company paying 10% dividend, an income of Rs. 500 is received. What price is paid for each Rs. 100 share?<br>
      Income = Rs. 500<br>
      Face value per share = Rs. 100<br>
      Rate = 10%<br>
      Total dividend on shares = Rs. 7,500 × 10 / 100 = Rs. 750<br>
      Number of shares = 500 / (10) = 50<br>
      Market value per share = Rs. 7,500 / 50 = <b>Rs. 150</b>
